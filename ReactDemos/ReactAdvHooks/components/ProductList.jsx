import React, { useState, useMemo, useCallback, useRef } from 'react';

/* 
useMemo: We'll use useMemo to calculate the total price of the products in the cart, and we want to prevent unnecessary recalculations when the list of products hasn't changed.

The totalPrice of the cart is memoized, meaning that it will only recompute when the cart array changes. If the cart doesn't change, the price doesn't get recalculated on every render, improving performance.


useCallback: We'll use useCallback to handle actions like adding a product to the cart, and we want to avoid recreating the function on every render.

addToCart and removeFromCart are memoized using useCallback. This prevents the functions from being recreated on every render, which can improve performance, especially if these functions are passed down as props to child components.


useRef: We'll use useRef to focus on the search input when the page loads, making it easier for users to start searching immediately.

searchInputRef is used to store a reference to the search input field. In the useEffect hook, we focus on the input field when the component mounts, so users can start typing immediately after the page loads.

With vs without these hooks: 

Performance:

With useMemo: Prevents unnecessary recalculations of values (like totalPrice) and ensures that expensive operations are only done when necessary (like when cart changes).
Without useMemo: Everything recalculates on each render, which can negatively impact performance, especially in large or complex components.
Efficiency of Functions:

With useCallback: Ensures that functions (like addToCart and removeFromCart) donâ€™t get recreated on every render, which can prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.
Without useCallback: Functions are recreated on every render, which can cause unnecessary re-renders of child components, even if those functions haven't changed.
Direct DOM Manipulation:

With useRef: Allows direct manipulation of the DOM (like focusing the search input) without causing re-renders.
Without useRef: You would need to manually handle DOM elements, potentially causing re-renders or requiring more complex workarounds.
